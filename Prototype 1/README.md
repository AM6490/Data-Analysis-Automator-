Prototype-1:

Progress is a little slow here given the amount of projects that I have to do for my other courses, but at least it is moving along at any pace. 

This initial project is relatively straightforward and unremarkable as all it does is check for missing data and generate some descriptive statistics. 

In the coming months I am hoping to connect this to a cloud system like AWS or some other platform to create a live AI model that can be fed data in real time and conduct analysis on it automatically.
