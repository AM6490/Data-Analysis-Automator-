So we've managed to get a semi-automated version of what we kind of want to do here in terms of automated data analysis.

The only thing is that this is a very basic and low-level form of performance. Since we not only have find and get the data ourselves but we also have to specify where its being store and what its doing. 

This is acceptable for now because it captures the essence of what I'm trying to do here, which is automating data cleaning and analysis.
